      <h2>Day 1</h2>
      <p>Begin a day dedicated to New York icons with a bird's-eye view atop the Empire State Building. Stroll up 5th
        Avenue past the leonine guardians of the New York Public Library and step inside to behold the gleaming Main
        Reading Room. Forty-second Street takes you east to the beaux arts Grand Central Terminal, a hub of frenetic
        activity and architectural wonder. Move on to the Chrysler Building, an art deco stunner, and continue east to
        the
        United Nations. Make your way west across 49th Street to the triumvirate of Saks Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller
        Center,
        and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Shopping, ice-skating at the Rockefeller rink, or visiting a nearby museum could
        fill
        your day until dusk, a good time to walk south on 7th Avenue toward the bright lights of Times Square.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <p>Set off in search of history via ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. An early start helps you beat
        the crowds, and after a thorough visit, complete with guided tours, you can expect to return six hours later.
        Back
        in Manhattan, walk through the Wall Street area, home of the colonial-era Fraunces Tavern and mid-19th-century
        Trinity Church. St. Paul's Chapel is Manhattan's oldest surviving church building and site of September 11
        remembrances. Just north is the neo-Gothic Woolworth Building (don't miss the splendid gilded lobby) and City
        Hall. The perfect place to take in the sunset is the esplanade along Battery Park City, easily accessed via
        Chambers Street. For dinner, choose among TriBeCa's many restaurants.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Day 3</h2>
      <p>Fine art and the finer things in life beckon, starting at the magnificent Metropolitan Museum of Art. You could
        easily spend a whole day here, but you'll exhaust yourself if you do. Luckily, just behind the museum lies
        beautiful Central Park, where you can collapse onto a bench, rowboat, or meadow and watch the world go by. For a
        romantic carriage ride through the park, hail a hansom cab at the park's south end, across from the Plaza hotel
        and the F.A.O. Schwarz toy store, both extravagances worth a peek. World-class shopping awaits on 5th Avenue and
        57th Street.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Day 4</h2>
      <p>First thing this morning, head west to the American Museum of Natural History. Take a gander at the dinosaurs
        and
        stop by John Lennon's last home, the Dakota apartment building on Central Park West at 72nd Street. Walk into
        lush, green Central Park itself to see its Shakespeare Garden, Belvedere Castle, Bethesda Fountain, and Wildlife
        Center (more familiarly known as the Central Park Zoo). After your dose of fresh air, shop 'til you drop along
        5th
        Avenue and 57th Street. Then treat yourself to dinner followed by a performance at Carnegie Hall or Lincoln
        Center
        for the Performing Arts.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Day 5</h2>
      <p>Do what many New Yorkers like to do on their days off -- wander. Make your way to Chinatown for a dim sum
        breakfast or tapioca-filled soft drink. From here head north to SoHo and NoLita for galleries and chic boutiques
        and restaurants. Farther east, the Lower East Side is a former immigrant enclave where you'll find the Lower
        East
        Side Tenement Museum and bargain shopping on Orchard Street. If you haven't eaten by now, hit a caf√© a few
        blocks
        north in the happening East Village, home to yet more shops and vintage stores. From Union Square, walk up
        Broadway to the fashionable Flatiron District with its inimitable Flatiron Building. Have dinner in one of the
        neighborhood's noted restaurants.</p>
