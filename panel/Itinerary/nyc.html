        <p>
        The Statue of Liberty is one of the most iconic symbols of Manhattan, it is situated on Liberty Island
        which is located in the Southwest of Manhattan.
        This giant classicism copper statue is a gift from the people of France to the people of the United State.
        It was dedicated in 1886 and had several restores from the late 1930s.
        A ferry ticket can be purchased to gain access to the island, it departs from Liberty State Park in Jersey
        City and the Battery in Lower Manhattan and also stops at Ellis Island,
        which gives you the option to combine multiple trips in one. Disembark at the Battery from the previous tour,
        walking along with the shore of Battery Park,
        the East Coast Memorial sits right between the Statue Cruises and Statue of Liberty viewpoint.
        This memorial honors the missing American servicemen who lost their lives during WWII in the Atlantic Ocean.

        <p>
        Taking the subway directly to the World Trade Center station, instead of seeing a pair of skyscrapers,
        what remained are two square pools which were the basement of the twin tower on a near-empty plaza.
        Both pools are surrounded by a stone structure with names of all identified victims engraved on it.
        The memorial museum sits between the south pool and the north pool. You can learn the full story of the
        attack on September 11, 2001, as well as the contradictions around the cause of the whole event.
        Heading north to midtown, you can reach the Empire State Building. It is one of the most famous landmarks of NYC,
        it is a 103-story building with observatories on the top of it. It was build in only 420 days and was the tallest
        building from 1931 to 1972. The Empire State Building is also featured in the movie King Kong,
        that at the end of the movie, the giant gorilla climbed on the top of the building and got shot down by airplanes.

        <h2>Day 3</h2>
        <p>
        There is no better place if you would like to experience the atmosphere of NYC other than Times Square.
        It is one of the busiest destinations in the heart of the Theater District, which is known for shopping,
        shows, dining, and dazzling lights. Despite how attractive those showcases are, do keep in mind that it is
        important to shop and consume wisely in order to save a budget for the remaining part of the trip.
