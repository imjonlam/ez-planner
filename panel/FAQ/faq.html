  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <section id="sections">
    <h2>What clothing should I pack for one of your adventures?</h2>
    <p>We always recommend packing as light as possible however the specific requirements for your tour will vary widely
      depending on where and when you are traveling. Our 'Trip Details' document includes a suggested packing list and
      these can be downloaded from each individual trip summary page. The checklist is tour specific and based upon the
      experience of our ground staff.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Do your tours include international airfare?</h2>
    <p>Travelers arrive from all over the world to begin our tours and it is not possible to include international
      airfare in our prices. We would be happy to help you arrange flights. Just ask for an air quote when making your
      booking.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What are the age restrictions on your tours?</h2>
    <p>To travel independently you must be at least 18 years of age. There are no upper age limits for most of our tours
      (although 18-to-Thirtysomethings tours are restricted exclusively to 18-to-39-year-olds). Also, travellers with
      pre-existing medical conditions are required to complete a medical questionnaire. Our Family Adventures are open
      to families with children aged between 6 and 17 years of age. Our standard (non-family) adventures are open to
      children aged 12 years or older when accompanied by a parent (max. two children per adult). The
      two-children-per-adult restriction does not apply to our Family adventures.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Can I join a tour late or leave it early?</h2>
    <p>It's extremely difficult if not impossible to join a tour after it has begun. It is possible to leave a tour
      early however you will be responsible for your own arrangements from the moment you decide to leave the tour. You
      would also be responsible for all costs associated with joining a tour late or leaving one early. If you feel this
      may be necessary please consult a G Adventures Specialist before you book your adventure.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What is the most appropriate type of luggage to bring?</h2>
    <p>We strongly recommend bringing a backpack or duffel bag, as suitcases can be cumbersome and difficult to store in
      buses, under seats, etc.. Keep in mind that you will normally have to carry your own luggage on and off buses and
      trains and up and down hotel staircases. Suitcases with wheels may not work well on dirt or cobblestone roads.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Who are my travelling companions?</h2>
    <p>For privacy reasons we cannot provide you with advance details on your traveling companions. However, our tours
      appeal to a wide range of travellers, most of whom share an adventurous spirit and a desire to experience these
      destinations at a grass-roots level. Our tours are conducted in English and so they attract many travellers from
      North America, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Can I book extra nights of hotel accommodation before or after my tour?</h2>
    <p>Yes, in most cases we can arrange additional accommodation at our starting or ending hotels, excluding European
      tours. Please contact a G Adventure Specialist for price information or check under “Hotels, Transfers & City
      Breaks” on the tour page of our website for prices. If we are unable to provide you with the extra nights we will
      give you the name of a hotel you can contact directly. Please also note that extra accommodations must be booked
      outside of 30 days of departure.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Are airport transfers included?</h2>
    <p>Most of our adventures do not include airport transfers and so we recommend you arrange a taxi on arrival (this
      is the most economical and efficient way of getting you to your hotel). If you would prefer a pre-arranged
      transfer these are usually available at an additional cost - please contact us for more information. Some of our
      adventures include an arrival transfer — departure transfers can be locally arranged at additional cost from the
      finishing point hotel.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Can you provide me with a list of the hotels we will be staying at?</h2>
    <p>Starting and ending hotels are listed on your travel voucher and in the Trip Details document. We use a variety
      of hotels en-route and so a complete list of hotels won't be provided until day 1 of your tour. If your family
      requires contact information, or in case of emergency, please have them phone x-xxx-xxx-xxxx. If our office is
      closed please refer to the emergency phone number that is found on the Trip Details document, this number can be
      reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Is tipping included and if not, how much should I budget?</h2>
    <p>Tips are not included in the tour price and tipping is entirely at your discretion. Our Trip Details
      documentation includes suggested tipping amounts and these can be downloaded from each individual trip summary
      page.</p>
